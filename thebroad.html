      This rebranding project, for THE BROAD Museum, was designed based on its innovative architectural styles: veil and vault concept —The vault is enveloped on all sides by the “veil”, an airy, honeycomb like structure that provides filtered natural daylight. I felt like there was something interesting about the capital B (which is the initial of broad): if you cut the ‘B’ halfway, you will get two ‘D’ shapes. and then you try to overlap these two ‘D’s, you will get 3 closed shapes which represents three floors in the galleries: exhibition, collection storage, lobby. Moreover, I decided to round all the straight angles of this overlapped ‘B’ logo, making it more smoother, as their architect design is pretty organic and natural.
