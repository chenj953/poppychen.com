    District86 is a registered not-for-profit online
    publication that promotes the development of the
    contemporary art scene in China by providing support
    for emerging Chinese artists and taking them to the
    international stage. 
    <br><br>
    Sadly, China’s Communist government has tightened its
    control over the Internet by creating a censorship system 
    called the Great Firewall. Its role in China is to block 
    access to selected foreign websites and to slow down 
    cross-border internet traffic. It cuts off local artist’s 
    access to the outside world. This long-term effect will be
    devastating. 
    <br><br>      
    We are building District86 to bring artists together in one 
    place where their work can be seen globally. “86” is the 
    international calling code for China. It symbolizes connections 
    between the outside world and local Chinese artists.
