        City Pop is an AOR/Disco/Funk/Jazz fusion genre which beamed out of the car stereos of inner-city Japan throughout the 80’s, existed as the soundtrack to the dream like, optimistic state that the country was enjoying due to the ‘Japanese asset price bubble’- an economic euphoria for Japan existent thanks to its worldwide technological exports throughout the 1970’s.
